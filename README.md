## How To Play?
- Use your left hand to drag and drop on the left side.
- Press the jump button to JUMP.
- The brick stairs won't move.
- The wooden stairs will flip 180 degrees. (If you continue standing on them, you will fall down.)
- The straw stairs will tremble and then dissolve. (Beware of this.)
- Finally, if you don't keep moving, the ghost will catch up to you, and then it's game over
(also, if you fall from the stairs off the screen, it's game over as well.)
